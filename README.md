# GenerativeMedia
Apps and tools for generating music and video from nothing (or very little)

This repository will have several projects in it. Currently there is 'futil' - for file utilities. It currently can read .wav files
and mix them together. The other project is 'inC' this is a web app that will generate a peformance of Terry Reilly's In C from a 
user entering the length of the performance and the number of instruments.


futil - utilities for processing media files currently, .wav files are read and written. also there is a mixer for combining pcm samples from multiple sources

dashMan - utilities for writing MPEG DASH HTML5 manifests. These are used so the streaming of generated media can begin before the entire 'performance' is generated
